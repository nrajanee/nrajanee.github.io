I am completing the Advanced Masterâ€™s Research Program at Columbia University focused in AI/ML track advised by Prof. Richard Zemel. My research focuses on AI robustness and safety, particularly in multi-modal large language models and their applications in fields such as healthcare. 

After graduation, (in May 2025), I want to contribute to building more trustworthy and resilient AI systems. I am open to opportunities in applied AI research and engineering.

Here's my [CV](/files/Nikita_Rajaneesh_CV.pdf) . 

## Research

### Towards effective discrimination testing for generative AI
Thomas P Zollo, Nikita Rajaneesh, Richard Zemel, Talia B. Gillis, and Emily Black. Towards effective
discrimination testing for generative AI. In ICLR 2025 Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models
and Applications, 2025. Full paper: arXiv:2412.21052.

Generative AI (GenAI) models present new challenges in regulating against discriminatory behavior. In this paper, we argue that GenAI fairness research still has not met these challenges; instead, a significant gap remains between existing bias assessment methods and regulatory goals. Through four case studies, we demonstrate how this misalignment between fairness testing techniques and regulatory goals can result in discriminatory outcomes in real-world deployments, especially in adaptive or complex environments. We offer practical recommendations for improving discrimination testing to better align with regulatory goals and enhance the reliability of fairness assessments in future deployments.
