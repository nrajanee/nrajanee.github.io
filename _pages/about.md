I am completing the Advanced Masterâ€™s Research Program at Columbia University in the AI/ML track, with my MS Thesis advised by Prof. Richard Zemel. My research focuses on AI robustness, reliability, and safety, particularly in multi-modal large language models and their applications in fields such as healthcare. Our paper "Towards Effective Discrimination Testing for Generative AI" was accepted in ICLR 2025 Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications, 2025. 

I am passionate about building more trustworthy and resilient AI systems and am open to opportunities in applied AI research and engineering.
